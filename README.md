Hi, you are stalking Bruna Shinohara (she/her)! I am a Staff Scientist in the Quantum Technologies division at CMC Microsystems.

A bit more about me:

# :computer: Staff Scientist, Quantum

I currently work as a Staff Scientist in Quantum Technologies at CMC Microsystems (Canada).
In my day to day work, I support industry and academic partners coming from different levels of contact with quantum computing. This encompasses helping with development of quantum
algorithms for different applications, providing access to quantum computers, estimating computational resources and adding error mitigation and suppression techniques. I have worked with different software development kits such as Qiskit, Pennylane/Strawberry Fields, Pulser and Bloqade and across different areas of applications,
such as healthcare, logistics, agriculture and arithmetic.

Another component of my work as Staff Scientist involves the development and delivery of training in quantum technologies, ranging from undergraduate and graduate-level to
non-technical audiences. I helped organize several workshops and hackathons on quantum algorithm tools and techniques.

# :tornado: Research

I have a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of São Paulo (Brazil), and I have also spent a period as guest research at the Center for Quantum Devices (QDev - University of Copenhagen, Denmark). My research focuseded on the theoretical physics of topological materials and their ability of supporting robust quantum computation.

Take a look at our paper, ["Can Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon and Majorana vortex states be distinguished in the presence of impurities?"](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.184509). Me and my collaborators, Dr. Antonio Manesco, Dr. Luis Gregório Dias da Silva and Dr. Nancy Sandler, explored how impurities can create  false-positives when attempting to detect Majoranas with STS 
measurements.

# :woman_technologist: Code

I am a big fan of Python! I have the IBM Certification of Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X and participate in Quantum Hackathons. I have content on Qiskit and Pennylane.

# :microscope:  Tech and Society

I am also involved in public discourseon the ethical aspects of quantum technologies. I was invited to speak about such topics in the
United States, Netherlands, Brazil and South Korea. 

Recently, I published an invited paper alongside Dr. Raymond Laflamme on Responsible Quantum Technologies in Canada and worldwide - [check it out!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05192)

Most of my scientific outreach content is in Portuguese, as less than 5% of the Brazilian population speaks a second language, and it is hard to find content about quantum physics in Portuguese. Some of my efforts in this sense can be found on my [Quora](https://pt.quora.com/profile/Bruna-Shinohara) webpage.

You can also check out my [Medium](https://smendoncabruna.medium.com/) page - I will be posting about some themes that interest me. 
My pinned post, about how to program a quantum computer with QisKit, can be found in Portuguese as guest posts in Brazil Quantum and Via Saber Medium pages.

I’ve also collaborated with PhET, the pedagogical simulations project from University of Colorado - Boulder. 
You can check out  [Hooke’s law](https://phet.colorado.edu/pt/simulation/hookes-law), the sim I’ve helped to construct, and many others on their website.

Finally, I have a series of posts on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shinossaura/guide/quantum-computing/17894358713238382/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=10567a83-a6a7-40a1-a6b4-8c1db3bf5b6f) about Quantum Physics and Quantum Computing :)
