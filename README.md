Hi, you are stalking Bruna Shinohara (she/her)! A bit about me:

# :tornado: Research

I am a theoretical Physics Ph.D. candidate at the University of São Paulo, and I have also spent a period as guest research at the Center for Quantum Devices (QDev - University of Copenhagen). My research is focused on the theoretical physics of topological materials and their ability of supporting robust quantum computation.

Take a look at our new article,["Can Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon and Majorana vortex states be distinguished in the presence of impurities?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05078). Me and my collaborators, Dr. Antonio Manesco, Dr. Luis Gregório Dias da Silva and Dr. Nancy Sandler, explored how impurities can create  false-positives when attempting to detect Majoranas with STS 
measurements.

+ [Link](https://lnkd.in/dNnar6Us) to a nice and more detaild twitter thread about it.
 

# :woman_technologist: Code

I am a big fan of Python! I use it for both my research (mostly Kwant) and studying Quantum Computing. I have the IBM Certification of Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X and participate in Quantum Hackathons. I have content on Qiskit and Pennylane.

# :speech_balloon:  Sciccom

Most of my scientific outreach content is in Portuguese, as less than 5% of the Brazilian population speaks a second language, and it is hard to find content about quantum physics in Portuguese. Some of my efforts in this sense can be found on my [Quora](https://pt.quora.com/profile/Bruna-Shinohara) webpage.

You can also check out my [Medium](https://smendoncabruna.medium.com/) page - I will be posting about some themes that interest me. 
My pinned post, about how to program a quantum computer with QisKit, can be found in Portuguese as guest posts in Brazil Quantum and Via Saber Medium pages.

I’ve also collaborated with PhET, the pedagogical simulations project from University of Colorado - Boulder. 
You can check out  [Hooke’s law](https://phet.colorado.edu/pt/simulation/hookes-law), the sim I’ve helped to construct, and many others on their website.

Finally, I have a series of posts on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shinossaura/guide/quantum-computing/17894358713238382/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=10567a83-a6a7-40a1-a6b4-8c1db3bf5b6f) about Quantum Physics and Quantum Computing :)
